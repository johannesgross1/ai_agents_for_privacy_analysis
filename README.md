# Bachelor Thesis: AI Agents for Privacy Analysis in mHealth App Traffic

This repository extends the source code from "A Qualitative Analysis Framework for mHealth Privacy Practices" with LLM based PII detection workflow.

**Original Paper:** DOI: [10.1109/EuroSPW61312.2024.00010](https://doi.org/10.1109/EuroSPW61312.2024.00010)

## Quick Start

Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt
Configure OpenAI API key in `.env`:

The complete workflow is detailed in `BA_Thesis.ipynb`, which contains:
- Data loading and preprocessing
- Regex-based PII detection
- AI-based PII detection using OpenAI Batch API
- Comparative analyses and visualizations

All new code for this bachelor thesis is located in:
- `src/thesis_ai.py` - AI-based PII detection module
- `src/thesis_plot_data.py` - Extended visualization functions
- `BA_Thesis.ipynb` - Main notebook containing the complete workflow
- `data_thesis/` - Data directory for thesis-specific data (batch files, results)
